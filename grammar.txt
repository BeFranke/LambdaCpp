// formal description of the grammar of the mini-language with tokens as smallest unit
// Terminal symbols are amendable by modifying class Symbol in src/headers/tokenizer.hpp
// e is the empty word
// UPPERCASE words are terminals that do not have a fixed representation, i.e. Variable names and numeric literals

<statement>         -> <assignment> ;
                    -> <rvalue> ;

<rvalue>            -> <expression> <conversion>
